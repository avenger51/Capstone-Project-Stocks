Capstone project proposal:

-The Stocks project is intended to provide a user with stock news and their own secure login that provides a stock ticker
symbol search that displays real time stock data:
                Closing Price
                Change
                Change Percentage
                High
                Low
                Open
                Previous Close
                Time

-A second function was to include a function for the user to add x amount of stocks at y price to build their own
portfolio, but time did not allow this to be added.
-The 'homepage' is designed to provide real time stock news.
